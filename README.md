# Psychic-Game

This game was created by Jaime Halupka as a requirement for homework during University of Central Florida's Coding
Bootcamp. 

**To Play**
The user must begin by pressing any letter (making a guess). If the user is correct, the win counter will increase by one. The user will have 10 chances to guess the correct letter. If they fail, the losses counter will increase by 1. There is a counter to keep track of remaining guesses as well as a running list of letters already guessed in each round. The game will automatically reset after each game, whether win or lose.
